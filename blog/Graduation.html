												Graduating from my M.S. in Civil Engineering is one of those milestones that looks simple from the outside (cap and gown, 
												photos, handshakes, a line on the resume), but feels more meaningful when you consider everything that led to that moment.
												It was the end of a chapter built out of late nights, deadlines, small wins, big doubts, and a lot of shared experiences.
												Looking back, I can see how much I've grown, not just academically, but personally. The friendships forged, the challenges overcome,
												and the knowledge gained have all contributed to shaping who I am today. What I didn't expect was how much graduation 
												would feel like a split in the timeline. Some stayed. A few friends continued into PhD programs, choosing the road of research. 
												But most people I spent the most time with, the ones who were there for my daily routine, left for good. New jobs, new cities, 
												new lifves in industry. Campus became a place they used to belong to. In graduate school, you learn that success is rarely 
												a one-person show. You survive because people around you share stress, jokes, meals, and even silence.

										<p>
											Like many students, my family couldn't be there for my graduation. That's a reality for many international students. The distance, 
											the visas, the finances, the logistics, the long calendar of sacrifices that comes with studying far from home. 
											I wish mum and dad could have seen me walk across that stage. They would have loved it. But I still felt grateful for the friends
											who came to support me.

													A lot of friends showed up. I guess milestones don't fully exist unless someone shares them with you. And on that day, 
													the people who shared it with me were the ones who had walked the whole journey beside me. So yes, graduation was a success.
													I earned my degree. I am really proud of it. I am also proud of the people who became close friends during this time. To mention some:
													Jesus Castro (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>), who was always there since day one, helping me navigate the new environment. Farid, 
													Juan Andres, Brenda, and Matt (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>), who were always coming up with plans to hang out.
													Some of them will stay in my life forever. Others will be memories I will cherish. But all of them made this chapter worth writing.
													One has to be happy about the goodbyes too, even though they are difficult, because they mean something good once existed.
