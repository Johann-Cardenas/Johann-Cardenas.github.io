											This project aims to better understand how electric commercial vehicles like semitrucks will affect asphalt pavements.
											Electric semitrucks will carry additional weight from large baterry packs and will have increased capacity for torque and potentially different weight distributions.
											The research team will get a head start on the weight distributions and torque capabilities of these new vehicles and will conduct large-scale testing
											and numerical modeling to determine the effects on flexible pavements to identify solutions to potential pavement distress and damage. This project will help Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) become ready for the electrification
											of the commercial fleet, helping save time and money once electric commercial vehicles are in operation.

														<p>Posted on July 31st, 2021</p>
													</header>
													<p style="text-align: justify;"> On July 9th, 2020, I would receive the call I had been waiting for. <a href="https://www.fulbright.pe/staff">Laura Balbuena</a>, 
														Executive Director of the Fulbright Peru Commision, was on the line and I was being offered a Fulbright scholarship to pursue a Master's degree in the United States.
														Because I submitted my application shortly before the deadline and this was the first time I was ever applying to any scholarship, I had kept my expectations low.
														I was in shock. <strong>I was going to the US! </strong> Fate had smiled upon me.
