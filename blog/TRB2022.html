												Your first TRB Annual Meeting hits you hard. The energy, the people, the sessions, the exhibitions, the networking events... everything is just overwhelming.
												Parallel sessions stacked on top of parallel sessions, makes any agenda instantly become aspirational fiction. 
												You walk in thinking you will attend <i>everything</i> relevant to your interest, and within an hour you realize the meeting is less 
												about covering content and more about learning how to navigate it. The most common first-time experience is a mix of excitement 
												and low-grade panic. Seriously, you keep checking the program, you keep making little plans, and you keep discovering 
												simultaneous sessions you <i>wish</i> you could clone yourself to attend. TRB is not a single conference, it's several micro-conferences 
												that happen to share hallways.

										<h3 class="entry-subtitle">Networking Opportunities</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">
											Some first-time attendees arrive with a mental model of networking that feels rather unnatural. 
											Like you're supposed to walk up to a stranger, deliver an elevator pitch, and exchange business cards.
											Reality is less cinematic and more human. You meet people in session Q&As, in poster aisles, in the 
											exhibits hall, and mainly during the social events. You bond over shared interests and common acquaintances.

													The common experience is realizing that the best conversations don't start with <cite>"Here's my research"</cite>, 
													but with <cite>"What are you working on right now?"</cite>. TRB is packed with researchers, practitioners, and 
													agency folks who are all there for the same reason: to learn and connect. If you are a graduate student, your job is 
													to ask sharp questions, connect ideas, and be honestly curious. The most useful networking at TRB feel less like 
													self-promotion and more like genuine conversations with peers. I must admit though that being part of ICT, has 
													facilitated introductions for me, as many people already know about the center and its work. They know my advisor 
													quite well, and opening lines like <cite>"Oh, you're working with Dr. Al-Qadi?"</cite> have helped me break the ice more than once.
													Then, I just have to explain what exactly I'm working on.

										<h3 class="entry-subtitle">D.C. Energy</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">
											Washington D.C. in January has its own personality: cold, brisk, and energetic. The city feels alive with purpose, as if everyone is on a mission.
											TRB becomes this intense bubble where days start early, end late, and include an impressive amount of walking. 
											You learn quickly that comfortable shoes are a must, and that planning your routes between sessions is key to avoid getting lost in the maze of
											hallways.

													During my first TRB, I started the week feeling like a student visiting the "real" transportation research world, and ended it realizing 
													I was already part of it. I asked questions during sessions. I talked to people whose papers I had read. I saw my research challenges 
													reflected in other people's work, from different angles, with different tools, and sometime with data I didn't even know existed. 
													As it is traditional, I couldn't miss the picture with the TRB sign (<strong>Figure 3</strong>) at the entrance of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.
													One final advice, it is always a good idea to team up with colleagues that have been to TRB before. They can help you navigate the chaos,
													recommend sessions, and introduce you to people (and take you to the receptions!).
