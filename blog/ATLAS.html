											This project aims to better understand how electric commercial vehicles like semitrucks will affect asphalt pavements.
											Electric semitrucks will carry additional weight from large baterry packs and will have increased capacity for torque and potentially different weight distributions.

											This project aims to better understand how electric commercial vehicles like semitrucks will affect asphalt pavements.
											Electric semitrucks will carry additional weight from large baterry packs and will have increased capacity for torque and potentially different weight distributions.
											The research team will get a head start on the weight distributions and torque capabilities of these new vehicles and will conduct large-scale testing
											and numerical modeling to determine the effects on flexible pavements to identify solutions to potential pavement distress and damage. This project will help Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) become ready for the electrification
											of the commercial fleet, helping save time and money once electric commercial vehicles are in operation.
