# Electric Trucks
- project: R27-252 Impact of Commercial Electric Vehicles on Flexible Pavement Performance
  role: Research Assistant
  duration: 2022 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: The main objective of the study is to assess the impact of electric trucks on flexible pavements, focusing on potential changes in IDOT pavement design (asphalt mixture and structure) and management.

# FAA Project
- project: Building Machine-learning-based Prediction Models for Computationally Efficient Airfield Pavement Analysis
  role: Research Assistant
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: This project aims to combine field data from various sections to develop more generalized prediction models. In addition to field tests, FAA has developed wide-ranging data sets based on in-house accelerated pavement testing (APT). The research team will also explore the APT data sets and investigate possible data fusion techniques to combine APT with in-situ data sets, which include response data obtained from actual airfield instrumentation.
