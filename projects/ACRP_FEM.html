											expected to be completed by July 2026. The final research paper will be presented at the TRB Annual Meeting in January 2027.

										<h3 style="line-height: 1.5;">Problem Statement</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.50rem;">
											The Aircraft Classification Rating-Pavement Classification Rating (ACR-PCR) system adopted by the 
											Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Advisory Circular 150/5335-5D (FAA,2022) provides airport 
											operators with a single pavement-strength number and an empirical rule that allows occasional overload 
											traffic of aircraft whose ACR exceeds the estimated PCR so long as such cases remain below 10% over the 
											rating and constitute no more than 5% of annual departures. However, the Circular itself acknolewdges that 
											this system is only intended for reporting pavement strength and is not a design or life-prediction procedure.
										</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.50rem;">
											Atlhough the ACR-PCR framework represents a clear advance over the previous ACN-PCN 
											system (Senseney & Sagisi, 2023), there are still critical gaps to be addressed. Moder wide-body aircraft 
											operate with tire inflation pressures near 250 psi and freature compelx landing-gear configurations that 
											produce highly non-uniform vertical and tangential tire-pavement contact stresses, while many general-aviation 
											runways consist of thin asphalt surfaces that can reach temperatures as high as 131°F (55°C) during summer. 
											Past research has shown that such conditions amplify rutting and shear strains beyond those predicted by simplified 
											closed-formed solutions (Gamez et al., 2018; Hernandez & Al-Qadi, 2015; Khresat et al., 2025). Additionally, full-scale 
											studies have evidenced that while thin and softend asphalt layers can deteriorate after a few oveerload passes, thick, 
											polymer-modified surfaces at large hubs could safely accomodate more passes than the aforementioned 5% rule 
											(Alves & Fontul, 2024; Brill, 2023). 
										</p>
										
										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1.00rem;">
											Recent evaluations of the ACR-PCR system have reported inconsistencies between the PCR and measured field performance, 
											where cross-sections with identical PCR experience different asphalt-related damage as the PCR does not capture 
											site-specific conditions, which calls for a mechanistic overload check (Armeni & Loizos, 2022; De Castro & De Oliveira, 2024; Sun et al., 2025). 
											The FAA's own Strategic Outlook for Pavement Research places allowable overload determination among its highest near-term priorities. 
											Yet, no framework currently links approvals to actual damage progression in asphalt runways. The present overload allowance 
											could be potentially unsafe for marginal runways and economically restrictive for robust ones that could benefit from a 
											deterministic decision-making approach.
										</p>

										<h3 style="line-height: 1.5;">Research Objective</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.50rem;">
											The objective is to supplemtn the existing ACR-PCR 5%-10% rule by developing a preliminary mechanistic framework where 
											incremental structural damage caused by each overload departure could be quantified and translated into a reliable allowance 
											policy for flexible runway pavements. This framework aims to help justify stricter or looser limits for overload permitting 
											using site-specific conditions (per runway, per season allowance). The study will:
										</p>

										<ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.00rem;">
											<li>Generate accurate three-dimensional (3-D) aircraft tire-pavement contact stress distributions for a critical wide-body aircraft.</li>
											<li>Compute time-dependent airfield pavement responses for a selected set of temperatures and structural configurations, using 3-D finite element modeling.</li>
											<li>Develop an operational screening framework that determines how many overload departures a runway can safely handle based on its remaining structural life.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3 style="line-height: 1.5;">Scope and Limitations</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1.00rem;">
											This study focuses on flexible runways pavement and will use a prametric matrix of representative average and extreme 
											pavement temperatures. The analysis will combine 3-D finite element (FE) modeling with existing mechanistic-empirical 
											damage models. Because the available data are insufficient to develop and calibrate a full aircraft model, the FE component 
											will use a simplified tire representation that still captures the effect of tread and rib imprint geometry, tire inflation pressure, 
											and load magnitude on the contact stress distribution. The flexible pavement FE model will be restricted to simulating a single 
											pass of the governing 1D, 2D, or 3D gear configuration for each selected aircraft. While the study will revise 
											existing large-scale performance data to evaluate the transfer functions embedded in FAARFIELD, it will not seek to 
											recalibrate or develop new transfer functions. The study will focus on assessing regional airports as these could be susceptible 
											to early deterioration due to disproportionate damage caused from occasional wide-body aircraft landing/take-off. The primary 
											outcome will be the estimated allowable number of overload passes before the flexible pavement reaches the end of its service life.
										</p>

										<h3 style="line-height: 1.5;">Methodology</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify;margin-bottom: 0.50rem;">
											The research proposal will be divided into five sequenced tasks (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>):
										</p>
										<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-top:0; padding-left:1.5rem; margin-bottom:1.25rem; text-align: justify;">
											<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Tire Contact Stress Modeling:</strong> Information will be collected to capture the tire imprint and contact stress distribution of selected aircraft.</li>
											<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong></strong>Airfield Pavement Modeling:</strong> Predicted 3-D contact stresses will serve as loading inputs to predict the response of a validated 3-D FE airfield pavement model.</li>
											<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Transfer Function Check:</strong> The performance of existing rutting and fatigue transfer functions as implemented in FAARFIELD will be evaluated based on the overload testing conducted at NAPTF.</li>
											<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Overload Permitting Framework:</strong> Transfer functions will be used along FE critical responses to estimate the maximum number of allowable overload departures <em>X</em> for a user-selected life-consumption limit or the maximum permitted take-off weight for a single overload case.</li>
											<li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Documentation and Technology Transfer:</strong> Deliverables will include a technical report, contact stress dataset, airfield pavement responses dataset, and source code to automate processing tasks.</li>

										<h3 style="line-height: 1.5;">Expected Outcomes and Impact to the Aviation Industry</h3>
										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.50rem;">
											The study will provide a preliminary mechanistic approach for evaluating occasional overload 
											operations on asphalt runways, enabling airport operators to issue overload approvals based on 
											real-site specific climate conditions and structural capacity, rather than a fixed empirical share of traffic. 
											Thin pavements operating at high temperatues could be protected through stricter overload limits to prevent early 
											deterioration, while stronger polymer-modified surfaces at large hubs could safely accomodate additional heavy 
											passes without premature damage, improving economic performance.
										</p>

										<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1.00rem;">
											This framework will supplement the ACR-PCR methodology, introduced by the International Civil Aviation 
											Organization (ICAO) and adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The ACR-PCR system 
											became fully applicable on November 28, 2024, as the standard reporting method, although the FAA has 
											extended the PCR reporting deadline for runways at Part 139 certificated airports to November 28, 2025. 
											The proposed overload method will provide a mechanistic bases for interpreting PCR values. Airport 
											operators are familiar with the legacy ACN-PCN method, and several studies have attempted to relate 
											ACN-PCN to the newer ACR-PCR system, despite the lack of a direct mathematical correlation between 
											these two methods. The main potential beneficiaries are medium-hub and non-hub airports. These airports 
											could avoid early deterioration from occasional wide-body aicraft operations, by setting runway and 
											season-specific overload caps, thereby deferring costly overlays and uplanned closures. Aircraft 
											manufacturers will benefit from a mechanics-based weight-approval criterion, while the academia and 
											airfield pavement engineers will gain access to an open dataset of high-pressure aircraft tire contact 
											stresses for future studies. Overall, this study will contribute to move FAA overload assessment towards 
											closer alignment with the mechanistic principles already embedded in its pavement thickness design 
											methodology, helping advance the Next Generation FAARFIELD objectives.
